# Angular Deployment Demo Notes

This document tracks the steps taken to set up deployment and CI/CD for the Angular application demo.

## Initial Setup
- Created `documents` folder for documentation.
- Added this markdown file to record deployment steps.

## Recommended Functionality for Deployment Demo
To demonstrate deployment and CI/CD effectively, I recommend adding the following functionality to the app:
1. **A simple interactive component**: Add a counter component that allows users to increment/decrement a value. This provides a basic feature to test builds and deployments.
2. **Environment-specific configurations**: Add environment files to show how different builds can be configured for dev/staging/production.
3. **Basic routing**: Ensure the app has multiple routes to demonstrate full app deployment.
4. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Set up automated building and deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Next Steps
- Implement the counter component.
- Add environment configurations.
- Configure GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Implementation Steps
- Generated a `counter` component using Angular CLI.
- Added increment/decrement functionality using Angular signals.
- Integrated the counter component into the main app template.
- Added basic styling to the counter.
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated build and deployment to GitHub Pages.
- Configured the build to use the correct base href for GitHub Pages deployment.
- Added production environment configuration (`environment.prod.ts`).
- Enhanced counter component to use environment variables (app name, production flag).
- Improved styling with modern gradient design, responsive layout, and smooth animations.
- Added comprehensive unit tests covering component functionality, environment integration, and template rendering.
- All tests pass successfully (12/12 SUCCESS).
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to include automated testing on push, pull requests, and manual triggers.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) includes:
- **Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests to main, and manual workflow dispatch
- **Steps**:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup Node.js 20 with npm caching
  3. Install dependencies
  4. Run unit tests (headless Chrome)
  5. Build for production with correct base href
  6. Deploy to GitHub Pages (only on main branch pushes)

## Deployment Instructions
1. Push the code to the `main` branch on GitHub.
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the app to GitHub Pages.
3. The app will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/CAD-angular-deployment/`

## Testing the Deployment
- The counter component provides interactive functionality to verify the app is working.
- Check that the build completes successfully in GitHub Actions.
- Verify the deployed app loads correctly on GitHub Pages.
- Unit tests ensure code quality and functionality.
