# 01 - Introduction to Angular (Vanilla JS to Framework)

## Why move from vanilla JavaScript?

Vanilla JS is excellent for learning fundamentals. As apps grow, teams need:

- predictable file structure
- reusable UI pieces
- clear separation of concerns
- testable, typed logic
- scalable architecture for collaboration

Angular provides these conventions out of the box.

## Formal Angular Definition

Angular is a **TypeScript-based front-end framework** for building single-page applications (SPAs). It includes:

- a component model for UI
- dependency injection for shared logic
- routing for page navigation
- forms and HTTP tooling
- strong CLI support for project automation

## Student framing

Think of Angular as:

- a **team-friendly architecture system**
- a **build pipeline** powered by Node/npm
- a **reactive UI model** with data binding and signals
