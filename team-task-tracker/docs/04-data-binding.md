# 04 - Angular Data Binding

This demo includes all four binding types together:

1. **Interpolation**: `{{ pageTitle }}`
2. **Property binding**: `[value]="newTaskTitle"`
3. **Event binding**: `(click)="addTask()"`
4. **Two-way binding**: `[(ngModel)]="newTaskTitle"`

## Teaching tip

Have students type into the two-way bound input and watch app state update immediately. Then compare it to signals to explain different reactivity tools available in Angular.
